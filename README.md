## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Title ‚Üí üê° Grouper: A Group Management System

Figma Design: [link]  https://www.figma.com/file/bEgkv9AFmRQUQjScNOZ7Es/dbms-final-project---grouper?type=design&node-id=2077-165&mode=design&t=bjTKNLUDYziLItog-0 

Problem ‚Üí With short semester classes and a busy workload, many university students struggle to find group members for their class projects that align with their skill sets. Forming project groups with a lack of initial socialization/introductions among peers can create unanticipated problems later on in the semester, ultimately leading to poor academic work.

Solution ‚Üí üê° Grouper provides a simple solution to the dreaded group selection process. 
- Each student will make a profile on our website listing their specific technical strengths and weaknesses.
- The student profile will also include an average performance rating that is given by other students from past projects.
- Professors can ask students to join class pages where they can track the general progress of each project group.
- In each class page, students can browse through different student profiles and create productive project groups.
