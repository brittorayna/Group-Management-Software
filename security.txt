To securely store the user's passwords we instead store a hash of the user's password.
Whenever the user signs into the site, we compare the hash of the inputted password to the one we have in the database.
This approach allows us to never actually store the raw value of the user's password,
meaning that in the case of a data breach, user's passwords are not exposed.
When hashing a salt is added to the hash to help prevent the hashing method from being discovered.
This would likely occur if all passwords were hashed in exactly the same way.
